# VR Tripn

We live in a world where technology evolves every year. Concepts that we thought could only be possible in science fiction movies have become reality with every day that passes.

In these challenging times that we found ourselves in, the world has changed so much. All the things we have taken for granted; we now realize how vital they are for enriching our lives.
One aspect that illustrates the massive change that the world is facing right now is travel and tourism; enjoying a holiday abroad, going on vacation somewhere new or even visiting local cultural sites have become inaccessible. Even before the global pandemic, travelling was a luxury that not everybody could afford. Travel costs, accessibility to different places, visas and paperwork, money, fear, to name a few were obstacles that were always present. 

VR-Tripn dissertation will intend to make travel and culture an accessible possibility for all. With a phone and a VR- Headset, people will have the opportunity to see some of the most amazing scenes in the world and know about the history and culture of famous landmarks without leaving the comfort of their own homes. 

This project will also make use of Machine Learning Technology to offer a better user experience, by selecting routes and places of the most interest for the user.
